                astronomy, physics, philosophy, and
                metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:</span>

            <span class="history__conteiner">This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the
                universe. The Big Bang
                theory suggests that the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago.
                As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of the
                cosmos.</span>

                    regions where gravity is so
                    intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can
                    emit radiation.</span>

                    to this theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain
                    additional microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined
